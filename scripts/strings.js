    "about": `this page a is a demo for some simple animation ideas of what one might call 
    'motion design' or something along that line, in web context. In essence a programming exercise gone out of control.
    As far as concept goes, i tried to stick as much as i could to latin text characters as the sole grphic element

    "dev_notes":`I made a point of not using any libraries, so it's basically vanilla javascript and CSS. 
    CSS animation is used quite heavily. In fact, the whole thing began as i tried to prove to myself 
    that CSS animation was a terrible idea (wasn't that bad as it turned out).
    More complex animation are very hard to achieve with CSS, so i used javascript for every frame on those. 
    I did use LESS for a while, but too briefly to mention. `,

    "sys_notes":`Regretfully mobile platforms are not supported presently. I tried to test with 
    a selection of laptop/desktop display resolutions, so hopefully it should work on these, 
    let me know if it looks wrong on your device (please supply device details)

    Due to the fact that everything is rendered in real time, some computational effort is needed, 
    so weaker computers may have a hard time and yield non great looking animation.
    What you gonna do. 
    I tried to make it light as I could without sacrificing the animation too much
    (mainly through using lower frame rate where possible), but it 
    still consumes considerable resources, at least at times.
